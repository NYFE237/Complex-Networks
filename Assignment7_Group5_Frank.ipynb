    "**(b)** Although the interaction networks in real-life are different from the social networks we have, it is still meaningful to simulate the epidemics cascade with our dataset. The SIR model was introduced in 1927 by Kermack. In this model, during the course of an epidemic, a node is allowed to change its status from Susceptible (S) to Infected (I), then to Removed (R). Please use the SIR model to simulate for 100 iterations the cascade of the epidemic with the same number of initially infected nodes (suggested 0.5), with the following three sets of infection/removal probabilities: (0.5, 0.2), (0.3, 0.3), (0.4, 0.5) on the network science dataset, and visualize the results."
